# URL

Do things with the title of a URL.

Similar to [Make a pretty Markdown link!](https://copy-url-title.glitch.me), but a _lot_ faster.

1. Make a Markdown link.
2. Make an HTML link.
3. Just get the title by itself.

## Setup

1. `mkvirtualenv url`
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. `chmod +x url`
4. Add a symbolic link to the `url` file somewhere on your path.

## Usage

```bash
url http://example.com
```
